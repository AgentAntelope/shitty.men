      <p>
        If you're reading this you've probably said or done something without
        thinking how your actions affect people around you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thankfully, there is still hope.

        Whoever sent you this link probably has some feelings on what you did

      <p>
        Ask them for a bit of clarification, then go awaay yourself and do some
        research on privilege, microagressions, and things you can do to help out
        others who don't look like you.
